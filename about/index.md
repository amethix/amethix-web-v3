		<p>We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it.
		With good data and the right technology, people and institutions today can still solve hard problems and change the world for the better.
		In 2004, when we looked at the available technology, we saw products that were too rigid to handle novel problems, and custom systems that took too long to deploy and required too many services to maintain and improve.</p>

		<p>We saw automated approaches that failed against adaptive adversaries, and all-or-nothing access controls that forced organizations to make unacceptable trade-offs between collaborating and securing sensitive data from misuse.
		We saw a need for a different kind of technology, and we knew it would take a different kind of company to build it. That’s why we founded Palantir. </p>

<h2 class="centered" id="content">Where does "Amethix" come from?</h2>
</div>
	<section>
		<div class="content">
		<p>
		Amethix comes from "amethyst", the violet variety of quartz.
		While in the modern age it is a stone used as a mere decorative emblem, ancient civilizations like the Greeks and the Romans used amethyst to make jewelry and amulets, placing a high value in this stone.
		The name amethyst translates in Greek to, “not drunken.” An ancient Greek myth explains this seemingly odd name. According to the myth, the god Bacchus was angry, and had vowed to descend a hoard of tigers upon the first person who crossed his path.
		Amethyst was on her way to give thanks at the shine of the god Diana, when she happened upon Bacchus.
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="content">
		<p>
		 Before the tigers could eat Amethyst, she was saved by Diana, who turned her into a clear crystal. Bacchus, remorseful for the fate he had so recklessly caused the girl, poured the juice of grapes over the stone as an offering, and thus bestowed the crystal with its unique purple coloring. The greeks gave amethyst crystal meaning, perpetuating a belief that it could inhibit the intoxication of all who wore it. In the Chinese philosophy of Feng Shui, amethyst meaning is quite different. Amethyst properties are not of sobriety, but of wealth in this ancient harmonizing technique. If placed in the wealth corner, amethyst can amplify the flow of prosperity into the home.
