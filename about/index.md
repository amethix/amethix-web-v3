		In the years we have seen many organisations failing and misusing off-the-shelf machine learning solutions that are not expensive to deploy and require little or no design effort. We believe in customised solutions. Because every problem is different, and every organisations have very specific requirements to satisfy.
		We saw a need for a different type of company, that is close to their customers from day one.
		That's why we founded Amethix Technologies.</p>

<h2 class="centered" id="content">Where does "Amethix" come from?</h2>
</div>
	<section>
		<div class="content">
		<p>
		Amethix comes from "amethyst", the violet variety of quartz.
		While in the modern age it is a stone used as a mere decorative emblem, ancient civilizations like the Greeks and the Romans used amethyst to make jewelry and amulets, placing a high value in this stone.
		The name amethyst translates in Greek to, “not drunken.” According to an ancient Greek myth, when the god Bacchus was angry he had vowed to descend a hoard of tigers upon the first person who crossed his path.
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="content">
		<p>
		Amethyst was on her way to give thanks at the shine of the god Diana, when she happened upon Bacchus.
		 Before the tigers could attack Amethyst, she was saved by Diana, who turned her into a clear crystal. Bacchus, remorseful for the fate he had so recklessly caused the girl, poured the juice of grapes over the stone as an offering, and thus bestowed the crystal with its unique purple coloring. The greeks gave amethyst crystal meaning, perpetuating a belief that it could inhibit the intoxication of all who wore it.
